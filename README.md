# Prompt-Engineering-4.1
# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description: 
## Background:
The Smart Health Assistant System (SHAS) is an AI-driven platform designed to provide personalized health recommendations, symptom analysis, and wellness tracking. This experiment explores how different prompting techniques can enhance the system's ability to generate accurate, context-aware, and user-friendly responses.
## Objective:
Evaluate the effectiveness of different prompting techniques in generating health-related responses.

Compare structured vs. open-ended prompts in symptom analysis.

Assess the role of few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting in improving diagnostic accuracy.

Analyse how contextual prompting enhances user interaction.

# Scenario 1:
Possible Causes of Persistent Headaches
1. Primary Headache Disorders
Migraines: Throbbing pain, often with nausea, light/sound sensitivity.

Tension Headaches: Dull, band-like pressure from stress, poor posture.

Cluster Headaches: Severe, one-sided pain around the eye (rare but intense).

## 2. Secondary Causes (Underlying Conditions)
Sinus Issues: Infection/allergies causing forehead/cheek pain.

Medication Overuse: Rebound headaches from frequent painkiller use.

High Blood Pressure: Can trigger morning headaches.

## 3. Lifestyle & Environmental Factors
Dehydration/Skipped Meals: Low blood sugar or fluid imbalance.

Sleep Disorders: Insomnia or sleep apnea.

Caffeine/Alcohol: Withdrawal or excess intake.

## 4. Neurological or Structural Problems
Concussions/Injuries: Post-traumatic headaches.

Brain Tumors (rare): Progressive pain with other symptoms like seizures.

Meningitis: Stiff neck, fever with headache.

## 5. Psychological Factors
Chronic Stress/Anxiety: Muscle tension or hormonal triggers.

Depression: Often linked to persistent head pain.

Output Format Options Available:

Clinical Note Version (as above)

Patient-Friendly Summary

ER Referral Alert (if red flags present)

# Scenario 2:
A user reports fatigue and dizziness. Possible causes: dehydration, anemia, low blood sugar. Example 2: A user has joint pain and swelling. Possible causes: arthritis, injury, autoimmune disease. Now, analyze: A user experiences shortness of breath and chest tightness."


### **Comparison to Prior Examples**  
| Case | Key Symptoms | Top Differential | Urgency |  
|------|--------------|------------------|---------|  
| Fatigue/Dizziness | Low energy | Anemia | Low |  
| Joint Pain | Swelling/stiffness | Rheumatoid arthritis | Medium |  
| **This Case** | **SOB + Chest Tightness** | **STEMI** | **High** |

### **Output Formats Available**  
1. **Emergency Department Report** (above)  
2. **Referral Letter to Cardiologist**  
3. **Patient Aftercare Summary** 

  ##  Analysis:
1.Improves accuracy by learning from examples.

2.Useful for structured symptom analysis.

# Scenario 3:
"A user says they have a fever, sore throat, and runny nose. Explain step-by-step what this could indicate."
Step 1: Rule Out Emergencies (Immediate Action Needed)
üö® Red Flags:

Struggling to breathe (e.g., wheezing, choking)

Severe dehydration (dizziness, no urination for 12+ hours)

Stiff neck + rash (possible meningitis)

High fever (>39¬∞C/102¬∞F) lasting 3+ days

üëâ Action: Seek ER care if any red flags are present.

## Step 2: Assess Symptom Patterns
üîç Key Questions:

How sudden was the onset?

Sudden (hours): Flu, COVID-19

Gradual (days): Common cold

Throat appearance?

White patches/swollen tonsils: Strep throat

Red with no pus: Likely viral

Nasal discharge color?

Clear/watery: Viral (cold, allergies)

Thick/yellow-green: Possible bacterial sinusitis (if lasting 10+ days)

## Step 3: Most Likely Causes
A. Viral Infections (Most Common)
Common Cold (Rhinovirus)

Low-grade fever, sneezing, mild sore throat

Flu (Influenza)

High fever, body aches, fatigue, dry cough

COVID-19

Fever, loss of taste/smell, sometimes runny nose

Mononucleosis (EBV)

Fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, prolonged symptoms

B. Bacterial Infections (Less Common, Need Testing)
Strep Throat

No cough, fever, swollen tonsils with white patches

Bacterial Sinusitis

Thick nasal discharge + facial pain after 10+ days

C. Non-Infectious (Rare but Possible)
Allergies (itchy eyes, no fever)

GERD (acid reflux causing throat irritation)

# Conclusion

Diverse Prompts Enhance Utility:

Diagnostic rigor (ChatGPT) + patient clarity (Claude) + safety (Copilot) cover all needs.

Adaptability is Critical:

Flowcharts guide lab workflows; multilingual support aids accessibility.

Actionable Outputs:

Blends immediate advice with contingency planning..

# Result
The experiment demonstrated that few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting provided the most accurate and logical health assessments, while contextual prompting delivered the most personalized recommendations. Zero-shot prompts were useful for general queries but lacked depth. Overall, combining these techniques can optimize the Smart Health Assistant System for both accuracy and user engagement.
